线程有6种状态：

- NEW
  - 尚未启动的线程的线程状态。
- RUNNABLE
  - 可运行线程的线程状态，等待CPU调度。
- BLOCKED
  - 线程阻塞等待监视器锁定的线程状态。
  - 处于synchronized同步代码块或方法中被阻塞。
- WAITING
  - 等待线程的线程状态。下列不带超时的方式：
  - Object.wait、Thread.join、LockSupport.park 
- TIMED_WAITING
  - 具有指定等待时间的等待线程的线程状态。下列带超时的方式：
  - Thread.sleep、Object.wait、Thread.join、LockSupport.parkNanos、LockSupport.parkUntil 
- TERMINATED
  - 终止线程的线程状态。线程正常完成执行或者出现异常。
